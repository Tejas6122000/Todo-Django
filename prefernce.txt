Q3. Which python framework is easier to work with & why ?

I found Flask to be quite easy as it just has one app.py file in which we can write all our backend code easily.
But for big projects there will be many pages and for that django is better as we can build multiple apps within a single django projects.
The code we write in Django's views.py is almost similar to that of Flask's app.py, hence I personally don't find django that difficult.
Additionally Django's prebuilt admin dashboard makes managing databases quite easy.
